I spent 11 weeks in the summer of 2021 working in the [Thermophysical Laboratory](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/thermophysics/) at Imperial, under the supervision of Martin Trusler. During this time I worked on a vba spreadsheet for flash calculations of arbitrary mixtures, implementing numerical methods for the first half, and new mixing rules for the one fluid approximation for the second.
