# Numerical Methods in Flash Problems

## Successive substitution
The most basic method of solving a flash problem is by successive substitution of variables, either $K_i$ component equilibrium variables, or $x_i, y_i$ composition variables.

Interestingly this has been shown to be a form of gradient descent. This is described in [Ammar 1987](https://doi.org/10.1002/aic.690330606).

## Acceleration steps
Honestly, I haven't been able to get any acceleration methods to work. Successive substitution works really well and I have been unable to improve it. 

Newton's method is effective in a small neighbourhood of the solution, having quadratic convergence. It can be calculated
