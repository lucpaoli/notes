| Title                                                                  | DOI                                                                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| The Isothermal Flash Problem: New Methods for Phase Split Calculations | [https://doi.org/10.1002/aic.690330606](https://doi.org/10.1002/aic.690330606)               | This summarises two main approaches at the time, minimisation and gradient descent. The maths is presented clearly, and the results are clear for the cases used.                                                           |
| The Isothermal Flash Problem. Part 1. Stability                        | [https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-3812(82)85001-2](https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-3812(82)85001-2) | Describes a method of deciding if a phase is stable. If the single phase system is stable, then no iterations are required, if it's unstable then you still obtain an accurate initial estimate for initialising iterations |
| The Isothermal Flash Problem. Part 2. Phase-Split Calculation          | [https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-3812(82)85002-4](https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-3812(82)85002-4) | Proposes a flash algorithm involving Broyden acceleration steps whilst far from the critical point, and Newton steps as you approach. I don't recommend working from this paper, later papers detail methods better.        |
| The Negative Flash                                                     | [https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-3812(89)80072-X](https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-3812(89)80072-X) | Discusses allowing negative vapour fractions in when solving the Rachford-Rice relation in the inner loop of a flash problem. It also shows that this corresponds to a saddle point in the Gibbs energy surface.            |
| Mixing and Combining Rules                                             | https://doi.org/10.1016/S1874-5644(00)80020-X                                                | Discusses theoretical boundary conditions, the Huron-Vidal Model and the Wong-Sandler Model                                                                                                                                 |
| Original Wong-Sandler Mixing Rule Paper                                | https://doi.org/10.1002/aic.690380505                                                        | Describes a composition dependent mixing rule                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Reformulation of Wong-Sandler Mixing Rule                              | https://doi.org/10.1002/aic.690410325                                                        | Reformulates the Wong-Sandler mixing rule to improve smoothness of transition between boundary conditions                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
